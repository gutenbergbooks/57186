<p><span class="smcap">Training</span> in the use of the bayonet is
receiving much attention from all the combatant
nations in Europe. The aim of the
instruction is twofold:</p>

<p>1. To develop great alertness of mind,
readiness of muscle, and habit of quick
obedience to command.</p>

<p>2. To develop fighting spirit.</p>

<p>Physical drill and bayonet training go
hand in hand and their drill periods follow
each other. The physical drill consists
of calisthenic exercises for fifteen or
twenty minutes, followed by some game or
exercise requiring great quickness of movement.
To accomplish the aims of this
training, especially the first named above,
it is necessary to execute with snap the
movements in the physical drill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>The following is from the latest British
Training Manual (1916), which is based
on their experience, and the forces are now
being trained in accordance therewith.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">To</span> attack with the bayonet effectively
requires <i>good direction, strength and
quickness</i> during a state of wild excitement
and probably physical exhaustion.
The limit of the range of a bayonet is
about five feet (measured from the opponent&#8217;s
eyes), but more often the killing
is at close quarters, at a range of two feet
or less, when troops are struggling <i>corps
à corps</i> in trenches or darkness.</p>

<p>The bayonet is essentially an offensive
weapon&mdash;go straight at an opponent with
the point threatening his throat and deliver
a thrust wherever an opening presents itself.
If no opening is obvious, then create<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
one by beating off the opponent&#8217;s weapon
or making a &#8220;feint thrust&#8221; in order to make
him uncover himself.</p>

<p>Hand-to-hand fighting with the bayonet
is individual, which means that a man must
think and act for himself and rely on his
own resources and skill; but, as in games,
he must play as one of a team and not for
himself alone. <i>In a bayonet assault all
ranks go forward to kill or be killed, and
only those who have developed skill and
strength by constant training will be able to
kill.</i></p>

<p>The spirit of the bayonet must be inculcated
into all ranks, so that they go forward
with that aggressive determination
and confidence of superiority, born of continual
practice, without which a bayonet
assault will not be effective.</p>

<p>The technical points of bayonet fighting
are extremely few and simple: the essence
of bayonet training, and continuity of practice.</p>

<p>An important point to be kept in mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
in bayonet training is the development of
the individual by teaching him to think and
act for himself. The simplest means of
attaining this is to make men use their
brains and eyes to the fullest extent by
carrying out the practices, so far as possible,
without words of command. This
procedure develops individuality and confidence.
Alertness and rapidity are qualities
to be developed also.</p>

<p>As technique of bayonet fighting is so
simple, long detail is quite unnecessary and
makes the work monotonous. All instructions
should be carried out on common-sense
lines. It should seldom be necessary
to give the detail of a &#8220;thrust&#8221; or &#8220;parry&#8221;
more than two or three times, after which
the classes should acquire the correct positions
by practice. For this reason, a drill
should rarely last more than thirty minutes.
It should be remembered that nothing
kills interest so easily as monotony.</p>

<p>The spirit of the bayonet is to be inculcated
by describing the special features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
of bayonet and hand-to-hand fighting.
The men must learn to practise bayonet
fighting in the spirit and with the enthusiasm
which animate them when training
for their games, and to look upon their
instructor as a trainer and helper.</p>

<p>Interest in the work is to be created by
explaining the reasons for the various positions,
the method of handling the rifle and
bayonet, and the uses of the thrusts.
Questions should be put to the men to find
out whether they understand these reasons.
When men realize the object of their work,
they naturally take a greater interest in it.</p>

<p>Progression in bayonet training is regulated
by obtaining: first, correct positions
and good direction; then, quickness.
Strength is the outcome of continual practice.</p>

<p>In order to encourage dash and gradually
to strengthen the leg muscles, from the
commencement of their training, classes
should be frequently practised in charging
short distances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_b_005.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>All company officers and noncommissioned
officers should be taught how to instruct
in bayonet fighting, in order that they
may be able to teach their men in this very
important part of a soldier&#8217;s training. It
should have place in all training schedules,
and in all rest periods in war time.</p>

<p>Sacks for dummies should be filled with
vertical layers of straw and thin sods,
leaves, shavings, etc., in such a way as to
give the greatest resistance without injury
to the bayonet. A realistic effect, necessitating
a strong withdrawal, as if gripped
by a bone, is obtained by inserting pieces
of hard wood, &frac14; inch thick (pieces of
crating or boxes), between the stuffing and
the sack on the side facing the attacker,
and the grain must be vertical.</p>

<p>These sack dummies can be made to
stand on end by fixing a wooden cross or
star (two or three pieces of wood about
two inches broad and &frac34; inch thick nailed
across one another) in the base of the sack
before filling it. They can also be placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
with good effect on rough tripods or tied
to improvised stools. Dummy sacks should
be suspended from gallows and weighted or
tethered to the ground from the bottom
corners.</p>

<p>By the use of a little ingenuity an officer
can readily represent the torso of an opponent
in positions simulating actual conditions.</p>

<p><i>The greatest care should be taken that
the object representing the opponent and
its support should be incapable of injuring
the bayonet or butt. Only light sticks (the
parrying stick here referred to is shown in
plates) must be used for parrying practice.</i></p>

<p><i>The chief causes of injury to the bayonet
are: insufficient instruction in the bayonet
training lessons; failure to withdraw the
bayonet clear of the dummy before advancing;
and placing the dummies on hard,
unprepared ground.</i></p>

<p>For practising direction, there must always
be an aiming mark on the dummy.
Cardboard discs for this purpose are desirable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
By continually changing the position
of the mark, the &#8220;life&#8221; of the dummies
is considerably prolonged.</p>

<p>In the absence of discs, five or six spots
or numbers can be painted on the dummies
as marks.</p>

<p>Intervals and distances will be taken as
in Infantry Drill Regulations, except that
in formations for bayonet exercises the
men should be at least six paces apart in
every direction. Classes should always
work with bayonets fixed.</p>

<p>Before requiring soldiers to take a position
or execute a movement for the first
time, the instructor shows them the position,
explaining essential points, and giving
the reasons for them. Then show the position
a second time, making the class observe
each movement, so that from the very commencement
of the bayonet training, a man
is taught to use his eyes and brain. The
class is then ordered to assume the position
explained and shown. Pick out the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
who shows the best position and let the
class look at and copy him. Remember
that his position may not be ideal, but it is
more correct than those assumed by the
remainder, who, being beginners, cannot
distinguish the difference between a good
position and an ideal one. Many instructors
err by trying to get a class of beginners to
idealize at once.</p>

<p>The recruit course consists of five lessons
and the Final Assault Practice.</p>

<p>The men should be accustomed to wear
the cartridge belt in the training, and packs
may be required to be worn in efficiency
tests. For the &#8220;thrust&#8221; and &#8220;parrying&#8221; exercises
a light stick, 5 feet to 5 feet 6
inches long and &frac34; to 1 inch in diameter,
must be provided for every two men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_b_011.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Half an hour a day, at least five days
a week, should be devoted to the daily
practice in bayonet fighting for trained
soldiers. By this daily practice accuracy of
direction, quickness, and strength are developed,
and a soldier is accustomed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
using the bayonet under conditions which
approximate to actual fighting. This half-hour
should be apportioned to (1) thrusting
at the body; (2) thrusting at paper balls
on light sticks at varying distances and
directions; (3) parrying light sticks; (4)
dummy work; and, when sufficiently proficient,
(5) the final assault practice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lesson I.</span></h3>

<p>Point of the bayonet directed at the base
of the opponent&#8217;s throat, the rifle held
easily and naturally with both hands, the
barrel inclined slightly (about 30 degrees)
to the left, the right hand at the height
of the belt grasping the small of the stock,
the left hand holding the rifle at the most
convenient position in front of the rear
sight, so that the left arm is only slightly
bent; <i>i.e.</i>, making an angle of about 150
degrees. The legs well separated in a
natural position, such as a man walking
might adopt on meeting with resistance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<i>i.e.</i>, left knee slightly bent, right foot flat
on the ground, with toe inclined to the
right front.</p>

<p>The position should not be constrained
in any way, but be one of aggression,
alertness, and readiness to go forward for
immediate attack (see Plate I).</p>


<p class="center"><strong>COMMON FAULTS.</strong></p>

<p>1. Leaning body back.</p>

<p>2. Left arm too much bent.</p>

<p>3. Right hand held too low and too far
back.</p>

<p>4. Rifle grasped too rigidly, restraining
all freedom of movement.</p>

<p>Assume the &#8220;order&#8221; in the easiest way
without moving the feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;High port.&#8221; In this position the hands
hold the rifle as in guard; the left wrist
level with, and directly in front of, the left
shoulder; the right hand above the right
groin and on level with the belt.</p>

<p>When jumping ditches, surmounting obstacles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
etc., this position of the rifle should
be approximately maintained with the left
hand alone, leaving the right hand free.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_b_014.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">PLATE I.&mdash;&#8220;GUARD.&#8221;</p>

<p>Being in the position of <i>guard</i>, to execute
&#8220;long thrust,&#8221; grasp the rifle firmly,
vigorously deliver the thrust to the full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
extent of the left arm, butt running alongside
and kept close to the right forearm;
body inclined forward; left knee well bent;
right leg braced, and weight of the body
pressed well forward, with the fore part
of the right foot, heel raised.</p>

<p>The chief power in a thrust is derived
from the right arm with the weight of
the body behind it, the left arm being used
more to direct the point of the bayonet.
The eye must be fixed on the object thrust
at. In making thrusts other than straight
to the front, the left foot should move in
the same direction as that in which the
thrust is made. During the later stages
of this lesson the men should be practised
in stepping forward with the rear foot
when delivering the thrust.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>COMMON FAULTS.</strong></p>

<p>1. Rifle drawn back before delivering the
thrust.</p>

<p>2. Butt of the rifle held as high as or
against the right shoulder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>3. The eyes not directed on the object.</p>

<p>4. Left knee not sufficiently bent.</p>

<p>5. Body not thrust sufficiently forward.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>REMARKS.</strong></p>

<p>The &#8220;long thrust&#8221; is made against an
opponent at a range of about four to five
feet from the attacker&#8217;s eye.</p>

<p>To withdraw the bayonet after a long
thrust has been delivered, draw the rifle
straight back until the right hand is well
behind the hip and immediately resume the
guard. If the leverage or proximity to the
object transfixed renders it necessary, the
left hand must first be slipped up close to
the stacking swivel and, when a pupil has
reached that stage of delivering a thrust
while advancing on a dummy, he will adopt
this method.</p>

<p>After every thrust a rapid &#8220;withdrawal,&#8221;
essential to quick work with the bayonet,
should be practised before returning to the
guard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><strong>PROGRESSION.</strong></p>


<p>First Practice:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_b_017.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">PLATE II.&mdash;&#8220;LONG THRUST.&#8221;</p>

<p>Men should always be made to thrust at
a target, <i>e.g.</i>, at a named part of the body
of the opposite man&mdash;&#8220;At the right eye;
thrust, withdraw.&#8221; Oblique thrust should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
be practised by thrusting at the men to the
right or left fronts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_b_018.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">PLATE III.&mdash;&#8220;WITHDRAWAL.&#8221;</p>

<p>As progress is attained, the pause between
the thrust and the withdrawal should
be shortened, until the men reach the stage
when they withdraw and come to guard
directly after making the thrust, judging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
their own time. They should be taught to
thrust at two or more parts of the body.</p>

<p>To practise action against a retreating
foe, first show the position of the kidneys
(small of back, either side of the spine).</p>

<p>If possible, the point of the bayonet
should be directed against an opponent&#8217;s
throat, especially in hand-to-hand fighting.
Other vulnerable and usually exposed parts
are on the face, chest, lower abdomen, and
thighs, and the region of the kidneys when
the back is turned.</p>

<p>Four or six inches penetration is sufficient
to incapacitate and allow for a quick
withdrawal, whereas if a bayonet is driven
home too far, it is often impossible to
withdraw it. In such cases, a round should
be fired to break the obstruction.</p>


<p>Second Practice:</p>

<p>The class working in pairs, with the instructor
supervising, should be practised in
thrusting in various directions: (1) at the
opposite man&#8217;s hand, which he places in
various positions on and off his body; (2)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
at thrusting rings, or balls of paper, tied
to the end of sticks (see Plates VI, VII,
VIII). This practice should be done without
the word of command, so that the eye
and brain may be trained.</p>


<p>Third Practice:</p>

<p>The men will be taught to transfix a disc
or number painted on a dummy; first at
a distance of about five feet from the
dummy, <i>i.e.</i>, the extreme range of the
bayonet; then, after advancing three or
more paces. The advance must be made
in the most practical and natural way, and
should be practised with either foot to the
front when the thrust is delivered. The
rifle must never be drawn back when making
a long thrust in a forward movement.
The impetus of the body and the forward
stretching of the arms supply sufficient
force.</p>

<p>The bayonet must be withdrawn immediately
after the thrust has been delivered,
and a forward threatening attitude be assumed
to the side or beyond the dummy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Unless the rifle is firmly gripped, it is
liable to injure the hand.</p>

<p>To guard against accidents, the men must
be at least five feet apart when the practice
is carried out collectively.</p>

<p>The principles of this practice will be
observed when thrusting at dummies in
trenches, standing upright on the ground
or suspended on gallows. They should be
applied at first slowly and deliberately, for
<i>no attempt must be made to carry out the
final assault practice before the men have
been carefully instructed in, and have
thoroughly mastered, the preliminary lessons</i>.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lesson II.</span></h3>


<p>THE RIGHT AND LEFT PARRY.</p>

<p>From the position of guard, vigorously
straighten the left arm, without bending
the wrist or twisting the rifle in the hand,
and force the rifle forward far enough to
the right (left) to ward off the adversary&#8217;s
weapon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>The eyes must be kept on the weapon
which is being parried.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>COMMON FAULTS.</strong></p>

<p>1. Wide sweeping parry with no forward
movement in it.</p>

<p>2. Eyes taken off the weapon to be
parried.</p>

<p>Men must be taught to regard the parry
as part of an offensive movement; namely,
of the thrust which would immediately
follow it in actual combat. For this reason,
as soon as the movements of the parries
have been learned, they should always be
accompanied with a slight forward movement
of the body.</p>

<p>Parries will be practised with right, as
well as with the left, foot forward, preparatory
to the practice of parrying when
advancing.</p>

<p>First Practice:</p>

<p>Men learning the parries should be made
to observe the movements of the rifle carefully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and should not be kept longer at this
practice than is necessary for them to understand
what is required&mdash;that is, vigorous
yet controlled action.</p>

<p>Second Practice:</p>

<p>The class works in pairs with scabbards
on the bayonets, one man thrusting with a
stick and the other parrying; the guard is
resumed after each parry. At first, this
practice must be slow and deliberate, without
being allowed to become mechanical,
and will be progressively increased in
rapidity and vigor. Later a thrust at that
part of the body indicated by the opposite
man&#8217;s hand should immediately follow the
parry, and, finally, sticks long enough to
represent the opponent&#8217;s weapon in the
position of guard should be attached to the
dummies and parried before delivering the
thrust.</p>

<p>The men must be taught also to parry
thrusts made at them: (1) by an opponent
in a trench, when they are themselves on
the parapet; (2) by an opponent on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
parapet, when they are in the trench; and
(3) when both are on the same level fighting
at close quarters in a deep trench.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lesson III.</span></h3>


<p>TO EXECUTE THE SHORT THRUST.</p>

<p>Shift the left hand quickly towards the
muzzle and draw the rifle back to the full
extent of the right arm, the butt either
upwards or downwards as a low or a high
thrust is to be made, then deliver the thrust
vigorously to the full extent of the left
arm.</p>

<p>The short thrust is used at a range of
about three feet, and, in close fighting, it
is the natural thrust to make when the
bayonet has just been withdrawn after a
long thrust. If a strong withdrawal is necessary,
the right hand should be slipped
above the rear sight after the short thrust
has been made.</p>

Lesson I should be observed so far as they
apply. By placing two discs on a dummy,
the short thrust should be taught in conjunction
with the long thrust, the first disc
being transfixed with the latter, the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
disc with the former. On delivery of the
long thrust, if the left foot is forward, the
short thrust would take place with the
right foot forward, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>Parries will be practised from the position
of the short thrust.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lesson IV.</span></h3>

<p>THE JAB OR UPWARD THRUST.</p>

<p>From the position of short thrust shift
the right hand up the rifle and grasp it
above the rear sight, at same time bringing
the rifle to an almost vertical position close
to the body, and, from this position, bend
the knees and jab the point of the bayonet
upwards into the throat or under the chin
of the opponent.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>COMMON FAULTS.</strong></p>

<p>1. Rifle drawn backward and not held
vertically enough.</p>

<p>2. Rifle grasped too low with the right
hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>From the jab position men will be practised
in fending off an attack made on any
part of them by an opponent.</p>

<p class="caption">PLATE VI.&mdash;&#8220;JAB&#8221; AT THRUSTING RING.</p>

<p>When making a jab from the guard, the
right, being in the thrusting hand, will be
brought up first.</p>

<p>The jab can be employed successfully in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
close-quarter fighting in narrow trenches
and when embraced by an opponent.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lesson V.</span></h3>

<p>METHODS OF INJURING AN OPPONENT.</p>

<p>It should be impressed upon the class
that, although a man&#8217;s thrust has missed
or has been parried or his bayonet has been
broken, he can, as attacker, still maintain
his advantage by injuring his opponent in
one of the following ways:</p>

<p>Butt Stroke I:</p>

<p>Swing the butt up at the opponent&#8217;s
crotch, ribs, forearm, etc., using a half-arm
blow or advancing the rear foot.</p>

<p>Butt Stroke II:</p>

<p>If the opponent jumps back so that the
first butt stroke misses, the rifle will come
into horizontal position over the left shoulder,
butt leading; the attacker will then step
in with the rear foot and dash the butt into
his opponent&#8217;s face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>Butt Stroke III:</p>

<p>If the opponent retires still farther out
of distance, the attacker again closes up
and slashes his bayonet down on his opponent&#8217;s
head or neck.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_b_030.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">PLATE VII.&mdash;&#8220;BUTT STROKE I.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>Butt Stroke IV:</p>

<p>If the thrust has been parried, the butt
can be used effectively by crashing it down
on the opponent&#8217;s head with an over-arm
blow, advancing the rear foot. When the
opponent is out of distance, Butt Stroke
III can again be used.</p>

<p>In individual fighting, the butt can also
be used horizontally against the opponent&#8217;s
ribs, forearm, etc. This method is impossible
in trench fighting or in an attack,
owing to the horizontal sweep of the bayonet
to the attacker&#8217;s left.</p>

<p>It should be clearly understood that the
butt must not be employed when it is possible
to use the bayonet effectively.</p>

<p>Butt Stroke I is essentially a half-arm
blow from the shoulder, keeping the elbow
rigid, and it can therefore be successfully
employed only when the right hand is
grasping the rifle at the small of the butt.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_b_032.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">PLATE VIII.&mdash;&#8220;BUTT STROKE IV.&#8221;</p>

<p>Butt strokes can be used only in certain
circumstances and positions, but if men
acquire absolute control of their weapons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
under these conditions they will be able to
adapt themselves to all other phases of in-fighting.
For instance, when a man is
gripped by an opponent so that neither the
thrust nor the butt can be used, the knee
brought up against the crotch or the heel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
stamped on the instep may momentarily disable
him and make him release his hold.</p>

<p>When wrestling, the opponent can be
tripped by forcing his weight on to one leg
and kicking that leg away from under him,
or any other wrestler&#8217;s trip; <i>e.g.</i>, &#8220;back
heel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The above methods will only temporarily
disable an enemy, who must be killed with
the bayonet, etc.</p>

<p>Practice:</p>

<p>When the classes have been shown the
methods of using the butt and the knees,
they should be practised on the padded
stick; <i>e.g.</i>, fix several discs on a dummy;
make a thrust at one; use the knee on
another, low down; jab a third, and so on.</p>

<p>Light but still sufficiently-strong dummies
should be used for practice with the butt,
in order to avoid damage to it.</p>

<p>It is apparent that bayonet fighting as
taught for trench warfare abroad lacks all
the niceties of the art of bayonet fencing
prescribed in our manual. <i>In bayonet fighting</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
<i>no &#8220;fouls&#8221; are known. The only rule
to follow is: &#8220;Get after your man, put him
out of action by any means at your command.&#8221;</i></p>

<span class="smcap">The Tactical Application of the Bayonet.</span></h2></div>


<p>A bayonet assault should preferably be
made under cover of fire, surprise, or darkness.
In these circumstances, the prospect
of success is greatest, for a bayonet is
useless at any range except hand-to-hand.</p>

<p>At night, all these covers can be utilized.</p>

<p>On the other hand, confusion is inherent
in fighting by night, consequently the execution
of a successful night attack with the
bayonet requires considerable and lengthy
training. Units should be frequently practised
in night work with the bayonet.</p>

<p>The bayonet is essentially a weapon of
offense, which must be used with skill and
vigor, otherwise it has but little effect. To
await passively an opportunity of using the
bayonet entails defeat, since an approaching
enemy will merely stand out of bayonet
range and shoot down the defenders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36-37]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p_3637.jpg" alt="" /></div>

It is attacked both ways, and the positions of the trench sack dummies are varied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>In an assault, the enemy should be killed
with the bayonet. Firing should be avoided,
for in the mix-up a bullet, after passing
through an opponent&#8217;s body, may kill a
friend who happens to be in the line of
fire.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>FINAL ASSAULT PRACTICE.</strong></p>

<p><i>This practice is to be carried out only
after the men have been thoroughly trained
in all the preliminary lessons and have
acquired complete control of their weapons,
otherwise injury to rifles and bayonets will
result from improper application of the
methods laid down in the foregoing instruction.</i></p>

<p>The Final Assault Practice must approximate
as nearly as possible to the conditions
of actual fighting.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>Nervous tension, due to the anticipation
of an attack, reacting on the body, as well
as the dash across the open and the final
dash at the enemy, combine to tire an assaulting
party. It is only by their physical
fitness and superior skill in the use of the
bayonet that they can overcome a comparatively
fresh foe.</p>

<p>Therefore, quick aim and good direction
of the bayonet when moving rapidly or
even when surmounting obstacles, accurate
delivery of a thrust and sufficient strength
and vigor to penetrate clothing and equipment,
the clean withdrawal of the bayonet&mdash;which
requires no small effort, especially
should it be fixed by the bone&mdash;are of the
greatest importance, and need the same
careful attention and constant practice as
are devoted to obtaining efficiency with the
rifle.</p>

<p>In the Final Assault Practice, the charge
brings the men to the first trench in a
fairly exhausted condition, and the accuracy
of the aim is tested by the disc,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
which can be perforated only by a true
and vigorous thrust and a clean withdrawal.</p>

<p class="caption">PLATE VIIIB.&mdash;EXAMPLE OF SHORT COMMUNICATION TRENCHES.<br />
Which should form part of the usual Final Assault Practice
Course, where, owing to the lack of ground, a &#8220;labyrinth&#8221;
for daily practice with the bayonet in the confined space of
a trench cannot be constructed within a convenient distance.
On arrival in France drafts are tested in trench
bayonet work.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>For this practice, the men should be made
to begin the assault from a trench six to
seven feet deep, as well as from the open,
and they should not cheer until close up to
the enemy.</p>

<p>A reproduction of a labyrinth of trenches
with dummies in the dugouts, and shelters
between the trenches, forms an excellent
Final Assault Practice Course. Assaults
should be made from all four sides, in
order to give variety. The edges of the
trenches should be revetted, otherwise constant
use will soon wear them out. Cinders
scattered over the course prevent the men
from slipping. If gallows cannot be
erected, sack dummies should be placed on
tripods or on end, as well as lying in
trenches, or on parapets, with soft earth
free from stones under them. The number,
length, and construction of trenches are
regulated by the available ground and by
the ingenuity of the instructors.</p>

schemes in trench warfare can be arranged
by combining the Final Assault Practice
with other branches of training; <i>e.g.</i>, bombing,
laying sand-bags, entrenching.</p>

<p>Competitions can be arranged by allotting
marks for: (1) number of discs transfixed
and carried on a bayonet; (2) time
taken for signal to charge until the last
man of the team passes the finishing post;
and (3) form.</p>

<span class="smcap">Tactical Principles to be Observed
During Bayonet Training.</span></h2></div>


<p class="center"><strong>METHOD OF CARRYING RIFLE WITH BAYONET
FIXED.</strong></p>

<p>QUICK SHORT ADVANCE (IN THE OPEN).</p>

<p>The rifle will be held at the &#8220;High Port.&#8221;
This position is suitable for close formation,
minimizes risk of accidents when
surmounting obstacles, and can be maintained
with the left hand alone, allowing
free use of the right when necessary.</p>


<p>LONG ADVANCE (CLOSE FORMATION).</p>

<p>The rifle will be slung over the left
shoulder, sling to the front and perpendicular
to the ground. This is a safe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
method of carrying the rifle and allowing
the free use of both hands.</p>


<p>LONG ADVANCE (OPEN ORDER).</p>

<p>The rifle will be carried at the trail.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>THE ASSAULT.</strong></p>

<p>The importance of discipline and organized
control throughout the conduct of a
bayonet assault can not be over-emphasized.
It must be remembered that in this, as in
all other military operations, success can
be achieved only through the closest coöperation
of all concerned; and that, while
individual initiative is not to be discouraged,
it must be strictly subordinated to
the intention of the leader of the assaulting
party.</p>

<p>Men should be shown by demonstration
that it is in their own interests to pay attention
to this point, and that the failure
of an enterprise can usually be traced to
the lack of this close coöperation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>During training, the following general
principles will be observed:</p>

<p>1. All members of the attacking party
must leave the trench or rise from cover
simultaneously. In addition to the advantages
of surprise, needless casualties are
thereby avoided.</p>

<p>2. The first stage, especially of a long
advance, will be slow and steady&mdash;not
faster than the pace of the slowest man.
Such an advance has a decided moral effect
on the enemy, makes certain of the maximum
shock at the moment of impact, and
at the same time allows the attacking force
to reach its objective without undue exhaustion.
On the other hand, if the assault
is allowed to develop without control and
in a haphazard fashion, the moral effect of
a steady, resistless wall of men is lost, and
the defenders may be given time to dispose
of their opponents in detail.</p>

<p>Bayonet control in the attack is just as
important and fully as practicable as fire
control, and it depends altogether on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
discipline, which must be taught by close-order
work, and on thorough technical
instruction in the use of the bayonet. Tactical
bayonet control will then follow without
much difficulty, provided the instructor has
done his work properly.</p>

<p>The actual charge will not be made over
a greater distance than twenty paces.
Within the last ten yards, and before closing
with the enemy, the rifle will be brought
to the threatening, yet defensive, guard
position. Line will, as far as possible, be
maintained until actual contact with the
enemy is gained.</p>

<p>As soon as the enemy&#8217;s position has been
carried, and prior to any attack on a
further position, or any other operation
whatsoever, every precaution must be taken
against a counter-attack. In trench warfare,
indiscriminate pursuit with the bayonet
must never be allowed unless orders
to that effect have been given by the leader
of the assaulting party. The attacking
troops are not so fresh as the enemy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
experience has shown that unorganized
pursuit lends itself to ambush and casualties
from machine-gun fire. In most cases the
work of immediate pursuit is better done
by the supporting artillery, the infantry
assisting by rapid fire on the retreating
enemy.</p>


<p class="center"><strong>ASSAULT PRACTICE.</strong></p>

<p>A useful form of Final Assault Practice
which can be adapted to a variety of combat
exercises is described in following
paragraphs. The following materials are
assumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;A.&#8221; Communicating trenches leading
to a fire trench with an open space in front.</p>

<p>&#8220;B.&#8221; An occupied enemy-trench.</p>

<p>&#8220;C.&#8221; Gallows with dummies, representing
the enemy.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) retiring from &#8220;B&#8221; or</p>

<p>(2) coming up in support of &#8220;B&#8221;
or</p>

<p>(3) making a counter-attack on
the captured trench &#8220;B.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_b_050.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">PLATE IX.&mdash;EACH DUMMY MUST BE REGARDED AS AN
ACTUAL ARMED OPPONENT.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>1. The attacking party makes a controlled
assault on &#8220;A,&#8221; which is cleared of
the enemy.</p>

<p>2. It then re-formed and an assault is
launched on &#8220;B,&#8221; after taking which</p>

<p>3. &#8220;C&#8221; is regarded in one or other of the
above ways, and action taken accordingly.</p>

<p>Throughout the training, men must be
constantly practised in:</p>

<p>1. The recognized method of carrying the
rifle with bayonet fixed.</p>

<p>2. Rapid advance out of deep trenches.</p>

<p>3. Control and maintenance of line and
opening fire during an advance.</p>

<p>4. Using the bayonet with effect in the
cramped space of communicating and fire
trenches.</p>

<p>5. Re-forming and opening of fire after
the assault.</p>

<p>6. Acting as leaders of attacking party.</p>

<p>Instructors should endeavor by every
means in their power to arouse the interest
and imagination of their men during
the assault practice. The special phase of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the combat which is to be carried out in
the exercise should invariably be explained
beforehand. Each dummy must be regarded
as an actual armed opponent, and
each line of dummies as an enemy line
attacking, defending, or retiring, and be
disposed of accordingly.</p>

<p>Any tendency toward carelessness or
slackness must be instantly checked, and it
should be impressed on all ranks that a
practice assault which is not carried out
with the necessary quickness, vigor, and determination
is worse than useless.</p>

<p>Lack of imagination, which allows men
and their leaders to violate the most elementary
principles of tactics in practice
assaults against dummies, can lead only to
disaster in a real assault against an enemy.</p>

<p>2. The position from which the &#8220;short

short thrusts will be practised from this
position. Except after a thrust into a
dummy, make a momentary pause in this
position so as to break men of the habit
of drawing back the rifle from the guard
before making the thrust.</p>

<p>3. From the outset squads will be frequently
practised in charging for short
distances in the open as a strengthening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
exercise for the legs and a quickening
exercise.</p>

be named when working by word of command;
it will be indicated by the position
of hand when working in class and be
clearly marked on all dummies.</p>

<p>5. When working in ranks, the distance
apart must be sufficient to avoid all danger
of accident when the thrusts are being
made. When thrusts have been made advancing,
the ranks will change position by
coming to the high port, doubling past each
other right shoulder to right shoulder and
turning about. When working against dummies,
men will always continue the movement
past the dummy, which they will
leave on their right.</p>

<p>6. The &#8220;withdrawal,&#8221; once taught, will
be made after each thrust. After a thrust

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
